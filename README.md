## File Descriptions
1. **Algorithm.java**: Implements the main algorithm for pathfinding on an 8x8 grid. It accepts user-defined constraints (`*`, `R`, `L`, `U`, `D`) and validates input before calculating valid paths.

2. **AlgorithmTest.java**: Runs tests on smaller grids (4x4 to 7x7) with all constraints fixed to `*`. This file is designed to compare performance against brute-force results.

3. **BruteForceTest.java**: Uses a brute-force approach to calculate paths for 4x4 to 7x7 grids. It serves as a baseline for comparison with `AlgorithmTest.java`.
